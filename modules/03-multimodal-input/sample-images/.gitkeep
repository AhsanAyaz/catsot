# Placeholder images for Module 03

This directory contains sample images for the multimodal input module:

- chart.png: Sample chart for data extraction demonstration
- code-screenshot.png: Code snippet for code analysis demonstration
- ui-mockup.png: UI wireframe for design analysis demonstration

All images should be optimized to ≤384px (width or height) to minimize token costs during the workshop.

Note: These are placeholder references. For actual workshop delivery, replace with real optimized images.
