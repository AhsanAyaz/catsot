# Module 01: AI Studio Exploration

**Duration:** 20 minutes (17 core + 3 buffer)

## Overview

Welcome to the first module of Code at the Speed of Thought! This module introduces you to Google AI Studio, the browser-based playground for Gemini. You'll learn the fundamentals of prompting and understand how AI Studio fits into the Google AI development workflow.

By the end of this module, you'll be comfortable navigating AI Studio, creating prompts, and viewing the API code that powers Gemini integrations. This zero-setup, browser-based approach is your entry point to all advanced Gemini capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Navigate the Google AI Studio interface confidently
- Create and run a freeform Gemini prompt
- View and understand generated API code exports
- Understand the basic prompt-response workflow
- Recognize how AI Studio prompts translate to production code

## Prerequisites

- **Google Account** (free) - Sign up at accounts.google.com if needed
- **Modern web browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest version)
- **Internet connection** - Required for AI Studio access
- **No coding experience required** - This module is beginner-friendly

## What You'll Build

In this module, you'll:

1. Create your first Gemini prompt in AI Studio
2. Experiment with model settings and parameters
3. Export your prompt as API code (Python example)
4. Understand how to iterate and refine prompts

This hands-on experience builds the foundation for all subsequent modules. Every advanced technique you'll learn later starts here.
