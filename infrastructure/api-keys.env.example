# Gemini API Keys for Workshop
# ============================================
#
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your keys:
#   cp api-keys.env.example .env
#
# Get keys from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
#
# ============================================

# Primary key (required)
# This is used by code that expects a single GEMINI_API_KEY
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-primary-key-here

# Numbered keys for quota rotation (recommended)
# QuotaAwareAPI uses these for automatic failover
GEMINI_KEY_1=your-primary-key-here
GEMINI_KEY_2=your-backup-key-2-here
GEMINI_KEY_3=your-backup-key-3-here

# Optional: Additional keys for larger workshops
# GEMINI_KEY_4=your-backup-key-4-here
# GEMINI_KEY_5=your-backup-key-5-here

# ============================================
# Quota Estimation for 40 participants, 3.5 hours:
# ============================================
#
# Free tier limits (per key):
#   - 15 requests per minute (RPM)
#   - 1,500 requests per day (RPD)
#   - 1,000,000 tokens per minute (TPM)
#
# With 1 key:
#   - 15 RPM = 900 requests/hour
#   - Insufficient for 40 concurrent users
#
# With 3 keys:
#   - 45 RPM = 2,700 requests/hour
#   - Workshop needs: ~500-800 requests total
#   - Safety margin: 3x-5x capacity
#
# Recommendation:
#   - Use 3 keys minimum for 40-person workshop
#   - Add more keys for larger groups or heavy API usage
#
# ============================================
# Google-Sponsored API Access
# ============================================
#
# This workshop may have Google-sponsored API access.
# Contact the workshop organizer (Google Stockholm) to:
#   - Confirm quota limits for sponsored keys
#   - Verify if higher than free tier
#   - Get instructions for using sponsored project/keys
#
# Sponsored access typically provides:
#   - Higher RPM limits (e.g., 60 RPM)
#   - Higher RPD limits (e.g., 10,000 RPD)
#   - No billing concerns during workshop
