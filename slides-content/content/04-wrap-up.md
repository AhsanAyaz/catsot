# Workshop Showcase

**Time for demos!**

Looking for 3-4 volunteers to show what you built

**Format:**
- 2 minutes per demo
- Show deployed URL (live demo)
- Share one interesting challenge you solved
- Questions from group

Who wants to go first?

Note:
- Showcase format: 3-4 volunteer demos (2 min each)
- Celebrate what was built (working code + deployed app)
- Reinforce what was learned (mental models, not just code)
- Provide next steps for continued learning
- Collect feedback

---

# What You Built Today

**Tangible outputs:**
- ✅ Deployed app with public URL
- ✅ Code you own (downloadable, shareable)
- ✅ Working knowledge of Gemini API

**Intangible outcomes:**
- 🧠 Mental models for architecting AI experiences
- 🔧 Practical patterns (context engineering, structured output)
- 🚀 Confidence to build more AI apps

**You didn't just follow a tutorial** — you understand HOW to architect AI

# What You Learned

**Part 1 Foundations:**
1. ✅ Freeform prompts → Structured output
2. ✅ Text-only → Multimodal (images + text)
3. ✅ Simple prompts → Context engineering
4. ✅ Static knowledge → Grounding (current data)
5. ✅ One-off prompts → Reusable logic systems

**Part 2 Application:**
6. ✅ Apply foundations to creative projects
7. ✅ Deploy to production (Firebase)
8. ✅ Handle real-world constraints (camera permissions, multiplayer sync)

**Core insight:** AI isn't magic — it's engineering

# Key Takeaways

**Mental models you can apply everywhere:**

1. **Schema-first thinking:** Define structure before prompting
2. **Context is king:** Better inputs = better outputs
3. **Multimodal by default:** Combine text, images, data
4. **Ground when needed:** Static models + real-time data = powerful
5. **Vibe coding workflow:** Describe intent → AI generates → you refine

**These patterns work beyond Gemini** — universal AI architecture principles

# Next Steps: Keep Building

**Extension challenges:**
- 15-26 challenges per project path (beginner → advanced)
- `part2/*/EXTENSIONS.md` — try harder challenges
- Build on what you started today

**New projects:**
- Combine concepts across modules
- Use custom project path template for your ideas
- Reference implementations in `part2/*/reference/`

**Goal:** Ship one AI app per week for next month
