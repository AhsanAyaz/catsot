# Code at the Speed of Thought Workshop

## What This Is

A 3.5-hour hands-on workshop at Google Stockholm (Jan 28, 2026) teaching 40 developers how to architect creative AI applications using Gemini and Google's agent-first tooling. The workshop goes beyond basic chatbot tutorials to explore context engineering, MCP tools, structured output, and multi-modal AI — delivered through multiple mini-projects with a Stockholm theme.

## Core Value

Attendees leave understanding *how* to architect AI experiences — not just having followed a tutorial. They walk away with mental models, working code, and a deployed app.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Workshop structure that covers 4 pillars in 3.5 hours
- [ ] AI Studio exploration segment (structured output, multimodal, grounding)
- [ ] Firebase Studio quick-build segment (vibe coding → deployment)
- [ ] Antigravity deep-dive segment (MCP tools, agent patterns, context engineering)
- [ ] Stockholm-themed creative project idea(s)
- [ ] Layered content (basics for all, depth for advanced)
- [ ] Reference materials (cheatsheets, templates, links)
- [ ] Zero pre-work setup (browser-based tools only)
- [ ] Attendees deploy at least one app with shareable URL
- [ ] Attendees have code they own (repo or export)

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app development — web-first, browser-based
- Deep backend infrastructure — Firebase handles this
- OAuth/auth flows — not needed for workshop scope
- Long-form video tutorials — this is live, hands-on
- Pre-recorded content — everything is live coding

## Workshop Structure

**Part 1: Foundations (13:00-15:00, 2 hours)**
- AI-native workflows with Gemini, AI Studio, and Antigravity
- Crafting better prompts, structured outputs
- "Vibe code" a small logic engine — setup ready for Part 2

**Coffee Break (15:00-15:30)**

**Part 2: Building with Firebase & AI (15:30-17:00, 1.5 hours)**
- Choose your own path — pick a project type
- Project options:
  - Face-reactive experience (like Mood Organism)
  - Gesture-controlled visuals (like ParticleZen)
  - Camera-based game (like Karachi Run)
- Iterate using natural language + Three.js or Canvas
- Deploy to Firebase

## Context

**The Speaker:**
Muhammad Ahsan Ayaz — has built creative AI experiences including:
- JourneyPath: AI-generated printable activities for kids
- Karachi Run: Multiplayer QR → selfie → emoji race game
- Mood Organism: Collective emotion visualization via facial expressions
- ParticleZen: Hand-gesture controlled 3D particle system
- AVE Studio: YouTube thumbnail analyzer with Gemini

**The Tools:**
1. **Google AI Studio** — Gemini playground (structured output, grounding, models, safety)
2. **Firebase Studio** — Web-based AI IDE with vibe coding and one-click deploy
3. **Antigravity** — Agent-first desktop IDE with MCP Store, agent skills, multi-modal

**The Audience:**
- 40 developers at Google Stockholm
- AI-curious, all skill levels
- Zero pre-work expected
- Google-sponsored API access

**The Promise:**
"Most AI workshops end where the interesting part begins... You've built the chatbot. You've prompted the model. Now what?"

## Constraints

- **Time**: 3.5 hours total (not 5.5 — breaks included in schedule)
- **Setup**: Zero pre-work — everything browser-based
- **Skill range**: Must work for beginners AND engage advanced folks
- **Tool priority**: Antigravity + MCP tools is the star; AI Studio/Firebase Studio supporting

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Multiple mini-projects over one big build | Shows breadth, prevents anyone getting stuck on one thing | — Pending |
| Layered approach | Mixed skill levels need different depths | — Pending |
| Stockholm theme | Local flavor makes it memorable | — Pending |
| Antigravity as primary tool | Where the "beyond chatbots" depth lives | — Pending |
| Substance over spectacle | Social elements shouldn't hide technical learning | — Pending |
