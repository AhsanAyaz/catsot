# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-24)

**Core value:** Attendees leave understanding *how* to architect AI experiences — not just having followed a tutorial.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Workshop Content Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Workshop Content Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 6 complete (01-02-PLAN.md)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-25 — Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (Structured Output Module)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 5 minutes
- Total execution time: 10 minutes

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2/6 | 10 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- 01-01 completed in 4 minutes
- 01-02 completed in 6 minutes
- Trend: Consistent execution speed (4-6 min per plan)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Workshop structure: Multiple mini-projects over one big build (shows breadth, prevents anyone getting stuck)
- Layered approach for mixed skill levels (different depths for different learners)
- Stockholm theme for local flavor and memorability
- Antigravity as primary tool (where "beyond chatbots" depth lives)
- Substance over spectacle (social elements shouldn't hide technical learning)

**From 01-01:**
- Freeform prompts only in Module 01 (establishes baseline before structured output in Module 02)
- Option A/B dual-path exercises (mixed skill levels self-select difficulty)
- "Going Further" sections for fast finishers (maintains engagement without instructor intervention)
- Screenshot placeholders deferred to Phase 5 dry-run (prevents rework if UI changes)

**From 01-02:**
- Description fields positioned as model instructions, not just documentation (critical insight for quality results)
- Schema enforcement vs prompt hacking distinction (fundamental mental model for structured output)
- Four edge case test scenarios in solutions (teaches robustness over single example)
- Common pitfall demonstration pattern (show what NOT to do cements learning)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 dependency:** Research summary flags need for phase-specific research on project branches (MediaPipe blendshape patterns, Three.js gesture controls, Firebase multiplayer state). Consider triggering `/gsd:research-phase` when planning Phase 2.

**Phase 5 timing validation:** Research notes dry-run needed 2 weeks before workshop (Jan 14, 2026) to validate 3.5-hour timing and identify friction points.

**API quota allocation:** Need to confirm Google Cloud quota strategy before Phase 4 (free tier is 250 req/day but unclear if per-account or per-project).

**From 01-01:**
- Screenshot placeholders: 6 placeholders in Module 01 demonstration.md need actual screenshots during Phase 5 dry-run
- UI verification: AI Studio interface should be verified 1 week before workshop (URL: aistudio.google.com)
- Module timing: 20-minute target needs real-world validation with pilot participant in Phase 5

**From 01-02:**
- Screenshot placeholders: 3 placeholders in Module 02 demonstration.md need actual screenshots during Phase 5 dry-run
- JSON Schema validation: Verify AI Studio schema editor still supports all features used (enum, minimum, maximum constraints)
- Description field quality: Solution examples should be tested in real AI Studio during Phase 5 to validate effectiveness

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-25 (Phase 1 execution)
Stopped at: Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (Structured Output Module)
Resume file: Ready to execute 01-03-PLAN.md (Multimodal Input) or other remaining plans
