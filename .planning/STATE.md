# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-24)

**Core value:** Attendees leave understanding *how* to architect AI experiences — not just having followed a tutorial.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Workshop Content Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Workshop Content Foundation)
Plan: Ready to execute (6 plans created)
Status: Planned - ready for execution
Last activity: 2026-01-25 — Phase 1 planning complete with 6 plans in 3 waves

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- No executions yet
- Trend: N/A

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Workshop structure: Multiple mini-projects over one big build (shows breadth, prevents anyone getting stuck)
- Layered approach for mixed skill levels (different depths for different learners)
- Stockholm theme for local flavor and memorability
- Antigravity as primary tool (where "beyond chatbots" depth lives)
- Substance over spectacle (social elements shouldn't hide technical learning)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 dependency:** Research summary flags need for phase-specific research on project branches (MediaPipe blendshape patterns, Three.js gesture controls, Firebase multiplayer state). Consider triggering `/gsd:research-phase` when planning Phase 2.

**Phase 5 timing validation:** Research notes dry-run needed 2 weeks before workshop (Jan 14, 2026) to validate 3.5-hour timing and identify friction points.

**API quota allocation:** Need to confirm Google Cloud quota strategy before Phase 4 (free tier is 250 req/day but unclear if per-account or per-project).

## Session Continuity
