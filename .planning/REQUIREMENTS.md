# Requirements: Code at the Speed of Thought Workshop

**Defined:** 2026-01-24
**Core Value:** Attendees leave understanding *how* to architect AI experiences — not just having followed a tutorial.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for the January 28, 2026 workshop at Google Stockholm.

### Part 1: Foundations (2 hours)

- [ ] **FOUND-01**: AI Studio exploration segment covering Gemini playground basics
- [ ] **FOUND-02**: Structured output demonstration (JSON responses from Gemini)
- [ ] **FOUND-03**: Multimodal input demonstration (image → text analysis)
- [ ] **FOUND-04**: Context engineering segment (prompt crafting, system instructions)
- [ ] **FOUND-05**: Grounding demonstration (search-augmented responses)
- [ ] **FOUND-06**: "Vibe code" logic engine build as shared foundation for Part 2

### Part 2: Choose Your Path (1.5 hours)

- [ ] **PATH-01**: Face-reactive experience option (MediaPipe face detection + emotion-driven visuals)
- [ ] **PATH-02**: Camera-based game option (multiplayer, QR-based, like Karachi Run)
- [ ] **PATH-03**: Custom project option for advanced attendees who want to build something original

### Materials

- [ ] **MAT-01**: Slide deck for concepts and demo flow
- [ ] **MAT-02**: Cheatsheet (single-page quick reference for Gemini API, MediaPipe, Canvas/Three.js)
- [ ] **MAT-03**: Starter templates with TODOs for each Part 2 project option
- [ ] **MAT-04**: Stockholm light-touch theming (framing, examples, but universal projects)

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **INFRA-01**: Offline fallbacks (local mocks if API/WiFi fails)
- [ ] **INFRA-02**: Firebase deployment path (one-click deploy during workshop)

### Delivery

- [ ] **DELIV-01**: Attendees deploy at least one project to Firebase with shareable URL
- [ ] **DELIV-02**: End-of-workshop showcase (3-4 volunteer demos)
- [ ] **DELIV-03**: Attendees leave with code they own (exported from Firebase Studio)

### Learning Outcomes

- [ ] **LEARN-01**: Attendees understand context engineering (prompt structure, grounding, system instructions)
- [ ] **LEARN-02**: Attendees understand structured output (getting reliable JSON from Gemini)
- [ ] **LEARN-03**: Attendees understand multimodal input (images as context)
- [ ] **LEARN-04**: Attendees can integrate MediaPipe for camera-based interactions

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future workshops or follow-up content.

### Additional Project Options

- **PATH-V2-01**: Gesture-controlled visuals option (hand tracking + Three.js manipulation)
- **PATH-V2-02**: Antigravity deep-dive (MCP tools, agent skills, advanced agent patterns)

### Additional Materials

- **MAT-V2-01**: Reference implementations (fully working examples beyond starter templates)
- **MAT-V2-02**: Pre-recorded demo backups (video fallbacks for live coding failures)
- **MAT-V2-03**: Extended workshop format (full-day version with Antigravity segment)

### Additional Infrastructure

- **INFRA-V2-01**: Dedicated Google Cloud project with elevated quota
- **INFRA-V2-02**: Camera test page (verify webcams before Part 2)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from this workshop.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Antigravity deep-dive | Not enough time in 3.5 hours; focus on Firebase Studio for zero-setup |
| Mobile development | Web-first, browser-based workshop |
| OAuth/authentication | Unnecessary complexity for workshop scope |
| Backend infrastructure | Firebase handles this transparently |
| Heavy Stockholm theming | Light touch keeps projects universal and reusable |
| Gesture-controlled visuals | Deferred to keep Part 2 options focused (2 paths + custom) |

## Traceability
