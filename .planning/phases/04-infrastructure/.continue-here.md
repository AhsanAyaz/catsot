<current_state>
Phase 4 planning is complete. Three execution plans (04-01, 04-02, 04-03) are ready.
Execution has NOT started yet. All Phase 1-3 work is complete and verified.

Next action: Execute Wave 1 plans (04-01, 04-02) in parallel.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 1 (Workshop Content Foundation): 6/6 plans complete, verified
  - Modules 01-06 created (AI Studio, Structured Output, Multimodal, Context Engineering, Grounding, Logic Engine)
  - All modules have README, demonstration.md, exercise.md, solutions/

- Phase 2 (Project Paths Development): 3/3 plans complete, verified
  - face-reactive: starter (60-70% + 2 TODOs) + reference + 21 extensions
  - camera-game: starter + reference + 26 extensions + Firebase emulator config
  - custom-project: blank canvas template + ARCHITECTURE-GUIDE.md + 15 example ideas

- Phase 3 (Supporting Materials): 3/3 plans complete, verified
  - slides/ directory with 5 Marp files + theme.css (58 slides total)
  - cheatsheet/cheatsheet.md + PDF (395 lines, task-frequency organized)
  - Stockholm theming applied (20% local, 80% universal)
  - Cross-reference network established across all materials

- Phase 4 Planning: Complete
  - 04-RESEARCH.md created with infrastructure research
  - 04-01-PLAN.md: Offline fallbacks (CDN + local copies, API mocks)
  - 04-02-PLAN.md: API quota monitoring (multi-key rotation)
  - 04-03-PLAN.md: Firebase deployment path (docs, testing)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 4 Execution (Infrastructure & Deployment):
  - Wave 1 (parallel): 04-01-PLAN.md + 04-02-PLAN.md
  - Wave 2 (sequential): 04-03-PLAN.md (has checkpoint)

- Phase 5 (Dry-run & Validation): Not started
  - Plans TBD during Phase 5 planning
  - Success criteria: timing validation, learning outcomes verification, deployment testing
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Marp over Reveal.js for slides (Markdown consistency)
- Task-frequency organization for cheatsheet (Quick Start -> Common -> Advanced -> Troubleshooting)
- 20% Stockholm theming, 80% universal content
- Canvas 2D over Three.js for face-reactive path (beginner-friendly)
- Firebase Local Emulator for camera-game (no production DB, no security concerns)
- 60-70% scaffolding strategy: complete infrastructure + strategic TODOs (not fill-in-blanks)
- Option A/B dual-path exercises for mixed skill levels
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- None currently blocking Phase 4 execution
- Phase 5 timing: Dry-run should happen 2 weeks before workshop (by Jan 14, 2026)
- API quota: Need to confirm Google Cloud quota strategy (free tier 250 req/day unclear)
</blockers>

Workshop: "Code at the Speed of Thought" at Google Stockholm, January 28, 2026
Duration: 3.5 hours (Part 1: 13:00-15:00, Part 2: 15:30-17:00)
Attendees: 40 developers, mixed skill levels, zero pre-work

Core value: Attendees leave understanding HOW to architect AI experiences, not just having followed a tutorial.

Project structure:
- modules/01-06/ - Part 1 foundation content
- part2/ - Three project paths (face-reactive, camera-game, custom-project)
- slides/ - Marp presentation files
- cheatsheet/ - Quick reference materials
- .planning/ - GSD workflow files (STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, phases/)

Performance so far: 12 plans completed in ~65 minutes total (avg 5.4 min/plan)
</context>

<next_action>
Resume with `/gsd:execute-phase` for Phase 4.

Execution order:
1. Wave 1: Execute 04-01-PLAN.md and 04-02-PLAN.md in parallel
2. Wave 2: Execute 04-03-PLAN.md (depends on Wave 1)
3. Verify Phase 4 completion
4. Update STATE.md
5. Proceed to Phase 5 planning

Command to run: `/gsd:execute-phase` (will detect Phase 4 as current)
