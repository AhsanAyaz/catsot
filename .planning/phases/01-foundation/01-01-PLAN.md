<objective>
Create Module 01: AI Studio Exploration - the foundational module introducing participants to Google AI Studio and basic Gemini prompting.

Purpose: This is the entry point for all workshop participants. It establishes the browser-based, zero-setup workflow and builds confidence with the primary tool (AI Studio) before introducing advanced concepts.

Output: Complete module directory with README, demonstration guide, hands-on exercise, and solutions following Google Codelabs pattern.

Create the instructor demonstration guide following the "Demonstration-First Learning" pattern from RESEARCH.md.

Content structure (5-7 minute demonstration):

**Introduction (1 minute):**
- What is Google AI Studio
- Why use it (playground for Gemini, zero setup, free tier)

**Step-by-step demonstration (4-5 minutes):**

1. **Navigate to AI Studio**
   - Action: Open browser, go to aistudio.google.com
   - Expected result: Landing page appears
   - Note: Sign in with Google Account if prompted

2. **Create new prompt**
   - Action: Click "Create new prompt"
   - Expected result: Prompt type selection appears
   - Action: Select "Freeform prompt"
   - Expected result: Prompt editor loads

3. **Write your first prompt**
   - Action: In the prompt field, enter: "List 3 benefits of using AI in developer workflows"
   - Expected result: Text appears in editor
   - Show: Model selection dropdown (gemini-3-flash-preview selected by default)

4. **Run the prompt**
   - Action: Click "Run" button
   - Expected result: Response generates in real-time
   - Point out: Token usage indicator, response time

5. **View API code**
   - Action: Click "Get code" button
   - Expected result: Code panel opens with Python/Node.js/curl examples
   - Show: How the same prompt looks as API call
   - Explain: This is how you'd integrate into your app

6. **Modify and re-run**
   - Action: Edit prompt to: "List 3 benefits of using AI in developer workflows. Format as JSON."
   - Action: Click "Run" again
   - Expected result: Different response (likely still text, not JSON yet - that's Module 02)
   - Point out: Iterative refinement is normal

**Key talking points:**
- Everything browser-based, no installation
- Prompts are shareable via URL
- Free tier for testing, paid tier for production
- This is the starting point for all Gemini integrations

Include placeholder text for screenshots: `[Screenshot: AI Studio landing page]`, `[Screenshot: Prompt editor]`, etc.

Create the hands-on exercise following the "Challenge/Solution Structure" pattern from RESEARCH.md for mixed skill levels.

**exercise.md content (10-13 minutes):**

**Your Task:**
Create your first AI Studio prompt and explore the interface.

**Setup (1 minute):**
1. Open browser and navigate to: aistudio.google.com
2. Sign in with Google Account
3. Click "New prompt"
✅ If you see the prompt editor, you're ready!

**Option A: Guided Challenge (For beginners):**

Step 1: Create a basic prompt (3 minutes)
- In the prompt field, write a question about a topic you're interested in
- Example topics: "Explain neural networks", "Write a haiku about Stockholm", "Debug this Python code: [paste code]"
- Click "Run" and observe the response
- Success criteria: You see a generated response

Step 2: Explore model settings (3 minutes)
- Click the model dropdown (currently showing gemini-3-flash-preview)
- View available models
- Try changing temperature slider (0.0 = more deterministic, 1.0 = more creative)
- Re-run your prompt with a different temperature
- Success criteria: You understand how model and temperature affect outputs

Step 3: Export API code (3 minutes)
- Click "Get code" button
- Switch between Python, Node.js, and curl tabs
- Copy the Python code to a text file (you'll use this concept in Module 06)
- Success criteria: You understand this prompt can become API code

**Option B: Independent Challenge (For advanced users):**

Goal: Create a prompt that demonstrates Gemini's capabilities and export it as API code.

Hints:
- Try asking Gemini to explain a technical concept
- Experiment with different temperatures
- View the generated API code
- Think about how this could integrate into your app

Solution: See `solutions/solution.md` if you get stuck

**For Fast Finishers: Going Further**

Try these extensions:
- Create a multi-turn conversation by adding follow-up prompts
- Explore the "Saved prompts" feature
- Share a prompt with a colleague using the Share button
- Try the "Chat prompt" type instead of "Freeform prompt"

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] You have created and run at least one prompt
- [ ] You have experimented with model settings
- [ ] You have viewed the API code export
- [ ] You understand the basic prompt-response workflow

Duration: ⏱️ Expected: 10 minutes | Buffer: 3 minutes

**solutions/solution.md content:**

# Module 01 Solution

## Example Prompt

**Prompt text:**
```
Explain how transformer neural networks work in simple terms.
Focus on the key innovation (attention mechanism) and why it
revolutionized natural language processing.
```

**Model:** gemini-3-flash-preview
**Temperature:** 0.7

**Expected Response Structure:**
- Definition of transformers
- Explanation of attention mechanism
- Impact on NLP
- Examples of transformer-based models (BERT, GPT, Gemini)

## API Code Example (Python)

```python
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3-flash-preview",
    contents="Explain how transformer neural networks work in simple terms. Focus on the key innovation (attention mechanism) and why it revolutionized natural language processing."
)

print(response.text)
```

## Key Learnings

- **AI Studio** is the playground for testing Gemini before coding
- **Prompts** are just text inputs that guide the model
- **Models** have different capabilities and costs (Flash vs Pro)
- **Temperature** controls randomness (0.0 = consistent, 1.0 = creative)
- **Get code** button shows how to integrate into your app

## Common Issues

**Issue:** "Sign in required" error
**Solution:** Make sure you're signed in with a Google Account

**Issue:** "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution:** Wait a minute and try again (free tier has rate limits)

**Issue:** Response is too long/short
**Solution:** Add instructions like "Keep it under 100 words" or "Provide detailed explanation"
